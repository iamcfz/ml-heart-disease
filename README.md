# ml-heart-disease
The objective of this project is to create a heart disease prediction model using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, predicting the absence or presence of heart disease. We used a Random Forest machine learning model and streamlit for display in Python. This cannot replace a proper medical examination, but an accurate model can assist doctors with diagnosing patients and ensuring quick, effective care.
